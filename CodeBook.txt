Data Set Description
=========================================================

The following data items are provided in the tidy data set (tidyData.csv or tidyData.txt).

Test.Subject.Number - The test subject identifier.  A number representing one of the 30 participants.
Activity.Name - A descriptive name of the activity being performed.  Each test subject performed each of six activities. (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING)

For each measurement a 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity were recorded. The X, Y and Z indicators for each data set identify the direction of the measurement.
All measures are recorded in Hz (hertz).
